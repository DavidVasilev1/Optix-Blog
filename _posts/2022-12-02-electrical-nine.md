<td> Board (Flipped) </td>
<td> Today the Flipped Board group continued CADing the board. We decided to ditch CADing the components for now and focus on getting the mounting + plates in. We finished one side of the board and got useful information on the mounting holes. For next meeting we would like to add a battery mount and finish our CAD üò≠üëç</td>

<tr>
<td> Board (Regular) </td>
<td> Lots of CAD work was done today. However we are still not done with CAD. We worked on getting more mounting holes but we ran into problems. Still looking for mounting holes for battery breaker and air compressor. Wiring got majority of our plan built.  </td>
