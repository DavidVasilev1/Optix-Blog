# Meeting Notes
 - Talked about how to use GitHub issues to organize code & planning
 - Worked on coding the intake subsystem in teams, using GitHub Branches
 - One team was able to successfully test!

## Homework
 - Look over your code, make sure it meets all the coding practices and works properly
 - When you think your code is good, merge it into the testing branch and then make a pull request into the main/master branch
 - Wait for us to review your pull request

## Goals for Next Meeting
 - Have more teams test
 - Talk about more key debugging concepts
