# Meeting Notes
 - Covered the basics usage & features of VS Code, java code structure & printing, and the barebones principles of Git & GitHub
 - We noticed that a few people had trouble with running java in VS Code, this is may be because you have your own version of VS Code open and not WPILib's
   - Remember, the WPILib suite comes with a java compiler & creates its own version of VS Code already configured for it. If you open your other VS Code, you will have to configure it yourself

## Homework
 - Use our [Java Training Repository](https://github.com/Team-Optix-3749/Java-Training) as a template
   - ![Use this template SS](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1016911506534830090/1023618265064423434/unknown.png)
   - View our slides from this week if you need a refresher on the terminology (We'll be going more in depth the next meeting so it's okay if you don't understand most of it for now)

## Goals for Next Meeting
 - Code, code code
 - Make sure everyone is on the same page
 - Stick to a proper timeline & agenda
