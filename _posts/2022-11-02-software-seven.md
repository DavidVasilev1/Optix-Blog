# Meeting Notes
 - Introduced how we control the robot using active inputs, such as the joysticks on a controller, using default commands and lambdas
 - Introduced and explained our robot code project workflows
   - How we use branches to ensure the proper functionality and seperation of competition code and code being developed

## Homework
 - Set up the repo you made last class with proper FRC branch workflows
   - Drivetrain code should be in a drivetrain branch
   - Shooter code should be in a shooter branch
   - Your main branch should ONLY have boilerplate code (Only what is generated by the WPILib project)
 - SEND US YOUR CODE
   - We will review and provide feedback on your code to ensure we don't waste any time next class debugging simple issues
 - If you already tested your code and fixed any errors you were facing, create pull requests to merge your subsystem branches into main

## Goals for Next Meeting
 - Test any untested code!
   - Drivetrain & shooter
 - Start other projects on VENOM
   - (Intake, NT, turret, shintake)
