# Meeting Notes
 - We started FRC training and you java training is officially complete ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶ðŸ¥¶
   - Its okay if you're behind on the java training slides and exercises, you'll become familiar with and understand the usage of all the topics we covered in the past 5 weeks through FRC training. This means that you should **focus solely on our FRC training curriculum instead of the java training** 
 - On Wednesday, those who came were able to run the code they wrote on venom & we covered the process for running your code using the FRC driver station and command pallete
   - Slides 87 & 88
 - FRC training is really tedious as theres a lot that goes into controlling robots. You need to code subsystems, commands, and robot container all before you start the process of testing.
   - If you missed this week, don't be overwhelmed by the amount of slides, a lot of them have instructions and such, but its **VERY IMPORTANT that you are caught up with the content this week.** Next week we're covering more advance topics building off of what we did this week.

## Homework
 - **Finish coding the shooter subsystem, creating upper and lower shoot commands, and binding them to button presses**
   - THIS HOMEWORK IS MANDATORY
     - If you don't have this done, you will be marginally behind and it will be much harder to contribute to the team when we split into project groups
     - If you're behind on java training, just get started on this and you'll learn all the java fundamentals along the way
 - FRC Code Base Quiz
   - THIS HOMEWORK IS OPTIONAL but is HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR THOSE WHO MISSED TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY
     - This will essentially test your understanding of the command-based programming paradigm in FRC 
     - The slides for a lot of the topics on the quiz start after 89

## Goals for Next Meeting
 - Go over answers for the shooter subsystem
 - Code code code the drivetrain
 - Kick out any electrical members tryna slide
