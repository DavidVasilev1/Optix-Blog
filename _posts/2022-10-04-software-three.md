# Meeting Notes
 - Most people got through all of today material faster than we expected (really good!)
 - Many people worked ahead and finished early (Ok as long as the concepts aren't too confusing)
    - Next week this probably won't be as good as the concepts are most likely new and difficult
 - Most people also seemed to understand the concepts or already knew them


## Homework
 - Do anything you didn't finish today
 - The homework is on your forked repository
`We will be checking this homework, make sure it is done well!.`

## Goals for Next Meeting
 - Code, code code
 - Retain more attention throughout meeting since concepts are more difficult (make them close their computers?)
