# Meeting Notes
 - We continued testing intake code from last week
   - Not all groups were able to run but a majority of them got their PRs reviewed and were able to test

## Homework
 - Create pull requests to merge your shooter and drivetrain branches to testing. Let us know when they are ready to be reviewed
   - This should only take a few minutes given that you've had your shooter and drivetrain code for a while now 

## Goals for Next Meeting
 - Log data using smartdashboard
 - Use turret limits and run
