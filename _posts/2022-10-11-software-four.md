# Meeting Notes
 - We didn't finish all the work, but we did get through some important concepts like Object Oriented Programming
 - We were missing a decent ammount of people (including Rohin and Rohan D:)
 - we got stuck on Lambdas for a while, if you don't understand them it's ok because they're confusing just learn to recognize them and copy their usage to start


## Homework
 - Do anything you didn't finish today
 - No extra homework this week because we didn't get to it!

## Goals for Next Meeting
 - Code, code code
 - Finish APIE (heavy concept) and hopefully get even more done to make up some lost time
