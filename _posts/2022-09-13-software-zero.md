# Meeting Notes
 - Covered class structure & how we code as a team @ Team Optix 3749
 - Went through the basic definitions and uses of Git, Github, WPILib, a few tools in the WPILib Suite, and FRC Game Tools
 - Most people got through making a GitHub account and installing Git
 - WPILib install took too long and had to cut other plans short
 - Rohin voice diff ðŸ˜³
