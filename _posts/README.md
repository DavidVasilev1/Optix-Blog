⚠️ Do not delete this directory!  You can delete the blog post files in this directory, but you should still keep this directory around as Jekyll expects this folder to exist.

# Auto-convert markdown files To Posts

[`fastpages`](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) will automatically convert markdown files saved into this directory as blog posts!

You must save your notebook with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`.  Examples of valid filenames are:

```shell
2020-01-28-My-First-Post.md
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.md
```

# Resources

- [Jekyll posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)
- [Example markdown post](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages/blob/master/_posts/2020-01-14-test-markdown-post.md)

# How to make posts (!Important)
- Create a post using yyyy-mm-dd-name nomenclature 
- in the categories: set it to you department with the first letter capitalized
    - i.e: Electrical
- In the tags, name them as such: Preseason, Build Season, or Postseason, depending on when they occur. If you have alternate tag names, let people know so they can be implemented
- This allows you page to automatically load with each post.
