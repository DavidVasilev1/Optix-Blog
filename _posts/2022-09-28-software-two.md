# Meeting Notes
 - Most people were able to fork, clone, make commits to, and push changes to their java training repository
 - Sometimes branches in VS Code didn't appear
   - This is because you need to include the `copy all branches` setting when creating a template!!!
     - This means you will have to make another template & clone it to get the branches on your system!

## Homework
 1. Have your fork cloned on your laptop
 2. Complete the activity in the printing folder of the week1 branch
 3. Push your changes & send the link to your repository to us! <br>
`NOTE: We, as leads, will provide feedback on the repositories you send us regarding your code, commit messages, etc.`

## Goals for Next Meeting
 - Code, code code
 - Stick to a proper timeline so that all topics are covered per week
