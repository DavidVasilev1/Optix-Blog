# Meeting Notes
 - Covered the basics usage & features of VS Code, java code structure & printing, and the barebones principles of Git & GitHub
 - We noticed that a few people had trouble with running java in VS Code, this is may be because you have your own version of VS Code open and not WPILib's
   - Remember, the WPILib suite comes with a java compiler & creates its own version of VS Code already configured for it. If you open your other VS Code, you will have to configure it yourself

## Homework
 - Coming Soon!
   - Check for pings in the discord, we'll let you know when the homework is updated

## Goals for Next Meeting
 - Code, code code
 - Make sure everyone is on the same page
 - Stick to a proper timeline & agenda
