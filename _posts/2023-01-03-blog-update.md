Hey everyone. As we are formally joining Open Alliance this build season, we have chosen to migrate from this blog to a different, Chief Delphi-based, blog. 

`Here is the link to the blog: <blog link pending>`

Don't write this web page off though, we may post other build-season related materials here.
